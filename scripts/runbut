;;; Commentary:

;; If you have several programs with the same name in $PATH, you can use
;; this script to avoid running particular ones.

;; For example, if there is "/bin/foo" program and you want to make a
;; wrapper shell script "~/bin/foo" (which has a priority in your
;; $PATH), this script may look like this:
;;
;;   #!/bin/bash
;;
;;   runbut foo "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" -- "$@" &>> /dev/null
;;
;; So when you run "foo" in the command-line, "~/bin/foo" is started and
;; with a help of "runbut" it runs another available "foo" (which is
;; "/bin/foo").

;;; Code:
