;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides procedures returning paths to my various files.

;;; Code:

(define-module (al places)
  #:export (home-file
            config-file))

(define home-file
  (let ((home (getenv "HOME")))
    (lambda* (#:optional filename)
      "Return file path by appending FILENAME to a home directory.
If FILENAME is not specified, return the home directory."
      (if filename
          (string-append home "/" filename)
          home))))

(define* (config-file #:optional filename)
  "Return file path by appending FILENAME to a config directory.
If FILENAME is not specified, return the config directory."
  (let* ((config-dir "config")
         (rel-name (if filename
                       (string-append config-dir "/" filename)
                       config-dir)))
    (home-file rel-name)))
