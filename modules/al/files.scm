;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides several additional procedures to perform various
;; actions on files.

;; The following procedures originate from (guix build utils) module:
;;
;; - mkdir-with-parents (from "mkdir-p");
;; - with-directory-excursion;
;; - which;
;; - find-files;
;; - delete-file-recursively.
