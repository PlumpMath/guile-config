;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides several procedures build around <source> record.
;; Source has an URI of the remote origin, and a local directory where
;; it should be put.  Currently a source is a git source (it is easy to
;; support other type of sources, but I only need git).

;;; Code:

(define-module (al sources)
  #:use-module (al records)
  #:export (make-source
            source*
            source?
            source-uri
            source-directory
            fetch-source))

(define-record-type* <source>
  make-source source*
  source?
  (uri       source-uri #f)
  (directory source-directory #f))

(define (git-clone repository directory)
  "Clone git REPOSITORY to DIRECTORY."
  (system* "git" "clone" repository directory))

(define (git-pull directory)
  "Run 'git pull' in DIRECTORY."
  (system* "git"
           (string-append "--work-tree=" directory)
           (string-append "--git-dir=" directory "/.git")
           "pull" "--verbose"))

(define (fetch-source source)
  "Fetch SOURCE from remote to local place.
Initialize the local directory or update it if it already exists."
  (let ((uri (source-uri source))
        (dir (source-directory source)))
    (if (file-exists? dir)
        (git-pull dir)
        (git-clone uri dir))))
